as technology population number planets increase need to be able to simplify, so planets become groups
etc lots of automated list

what can be learned from the 
nemisis system 
dwarven forge
and the ability to influence and change your own society
have your society change due to events
that will result in emergent water cooler stories

what do we want from the game
-to be alterable
-to be fun
-to not be bogged down busy work
-to make you feel satisfied as a planner
-to have a story after
-to feel epic
-to feel when the end is acheived its satisfy and has happened on a beat
-to not end with inevibility -- look up ideas we wrote down about bidding via aliances saying i will do x in ten turns and crown myself
winner, and then there are ten turns to stop it etc or to join it via an aliance etc
-to feel like a diplomat
-to feel like a warmonger,peacemonger --- make other peaceful too
-to feel proud of technilogoical or cultural feats
-to feel proud of protecting or change culture of your people
-to feel proud of dominance defeating all planets
-to feel machevellian and manipulate own ppl and universe alike

---universe news events everyone sees and people can try and spin internally and or externally - to shape them or how they shape your ppl

personality creator like fallout character creator but polar chart maybe so 3 aspects may pull on the effect of a decision
maybe positive choice so moral flexibility goes from ultr-resolute to ultr-pragmatic --- resolute means less impacted by events to change personality of ppl
ultr pragmatic can shape ppl easier yourself more adaptable.   so strength in following path or ability change path

sabotage to work by granularity, can chose to attack aspect, or system group, or system, or part of system e.g. assembly line more specific more multiples stronger inteligence score required or time it takes
-works like military chose how long to spend on a task, is like commititng more ships to  battle

high levels science allow create space topography dust clouds etc

trade roots should be automatic but can change them to avoid areas prone to attack, length in squares reduces value get per turn so want shortest route

can chose to remove planet from trade network will make it harder to get information about.

lots ux so should be able to multi select map or tables and apply build orders or actions to them together
with high espionage should be able to click on enemies planet and see a 5 tiers info, what they have, what they last built, what they are planning to build, planet build history, planet workforce task history -e.g. graph of how often was in shadow teams
-with sabotage attack those things

-attack trade routes like attack roads

-can in peace treaties and gift give technology 
-can give ships
-if give technology or its stollen until your next tech level your ships systems 20% less offensive an defensive against the enemy 
enemy can try to build you tech -- but that tech is capped at stollen level and is vulnerable to races who know it
-when reach a new tech level you retro fit your encryption

this means you could give tech to someone then be at war and both be vulnerable to each other with that tech, if they give that tech away
themselves then your enemies can use it against you too, so sharing tech doubles your risk of enemies getting hold of it 



-----
start new turn get the new popup this allows you to intercept the news and spin it, and the points needed to do this based on internal intelligence
which makes you aware of news, and informs you to some level of accuracy of what the account could be. war declared could be twisted to no it wasnt, sad but invitable, our heroic defiance
with different suspected outcome -- ppl more unhappy but more likely to become more warlike in future etc. // decisions based on trading happiness, control, outlook of population short term and longterm
your decisions may lose you happiness now but help you change outlook of the people.
Excess points can be used to create fake news. 
----
turns, ten turns, and 100 turns certain known event happen so maybe only every ten turns do you do x. every 100 turns people become more reflective and can effect their outlook etc
