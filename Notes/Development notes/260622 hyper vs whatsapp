hyper is something i used on my web course a while ago, it is built ontop of command prompt terminal i assume
and it is useful for things like node, and npm for installing things

though for a stack using visual studio im not sure what npm and what nuget stuff we will use yet

getting visual studio community 2022
i added git 
think will need to add other things in future - when research what postgres and react needs
think installed lots i didnt need but i have the space think f# stuff and sql stuff could have gone

then i will install in a folder
